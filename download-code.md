# Downloading the Complete Codebase

Since we're unable to directly push the entire codebase to GitHub from this environment, here's how you can download the code and push it to your repository:

## Option 1: Clone the Repository and Add Code Manually

1. Clone the empty repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/atlasgrowth23/erin-website.git
   cd erin-website
   ```

2. Download the entire codebase from your Replit environment:
   - Go to your Replit project
   - Click on the three dots menu (⋮) in the files section
   - Select "Download as zip"
   - Extract the ZIP file on your local machine

3. Copy all files from the extracted ZIP to your cloned repository folder
   - Make sure to exclude the `.git` folder from the ZIP

4. Push the code to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add complete codebase"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Option 2: Use the GitHub Import Feature

1. Export your Replit project as a ZIP file
   - Go to your Replit project
   - Click on the three dots menu (⋮) in the files section
   - Select "Download as zip"

2. Create a new GitHub repository using the import feature:
   - Go to https://github.com/new/import
   - In "Your old repository's clone URL," paste https://github.com/atlasgrowth23/erin-website.git
   - Choose your account for the owner
   - Give it the same name: erin-website
   - Click "Begin import"

3. Once imported, you can then add your code to this repository
