# Downloading the Complete Codebase

I've created a GitHub release with a downloadable ZIP file of the codebase for you!

## Option 1: Download the Release ZIP (EASIEST METHOD)

1. Go to: https://github.com/atlasgrowth23/erin-website/releases/tag/v1.0.0
2. Click on the "Source code (zip)" link to download the full codebase as a ZIP file
3. Extract the ZIP file on your local machine

This ZIP file includes the complete codebase with all files properly organized.

## Option 2: Clone the Repository and Add Code Manually

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/atlasgrowth23/erin-website.git
   cd erin-website
   ```

2. Download the entire codebase from your Replit environment:
   - Go to your Replit project
   - Click on the three dots menu (⋮) in the files section
   - Select "Download as zip"
   - Extract the ZIP file on your local machine

3. Copy all files from the extracted ZIP to your cloned repository folder
   - Make sure to exclude the `.git` folder from the ZIP

4. Push the code to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add complete codebase"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Option 2: Use the GitHub Import Feature

1. Export your Replit project as a ZIP file
   - Go to your Replit project
   - Click on the three dots menu (⋮) in the files section
   - Select "Download as zip"

2. Create a new GitHub repository using the import feature:
   - Go to https://github.com/new/import
   - In "Your old repository's clone URL," paste https://github.com/atlasgrowth23/erin-website.git
   - Choose your account for the owner
   - Give it the same name: erin-website
   - Click "Begin import"

3. Once imported, you can then add your code to this repository
